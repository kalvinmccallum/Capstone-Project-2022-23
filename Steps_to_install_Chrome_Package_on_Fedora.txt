In terminal, first install fedora-packager , rpmdevtools , @development-tools.

  [username@fedora ~]$ sudo dnf install fedora-packager rpmdevtools

Enter your password. Once it installs, cd into the folder where you want the rpm file downloaded from the web.

  [username@fedora ~]$ cd ~/rpmbuild/RPMS

  [username@fedora RPMS]$ wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_x86_64.rpm
